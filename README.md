# Missing Return Statement in Next.js Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications: a missing `return` statement in a page component.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and runtime errors.

## Bug
The `pages/about.js` file is missing a `return` statement within the `About` component's functional component. This causes Next.js to not render anything for the `/about` route, and might throw an error.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a `return` statement to the `About` component, ensuring that JSX is returned.  This correctly renders the component and addresses the bug.
